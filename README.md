# Image Based Air Pollution detection using Inception-V3 Model

 In this project work, the main motive is to build a deep 
learning model to detect air pollution from real-time images. In order 
to achieve that goal, we have collected data from different sources 
and then enhanced the low-quality images using the Image 
enhancement technique. Our next step was to train a CNN 
(Convolutional Neural Network) on the images in order to detect the 
air pollution by analysing the clearness of the sky in the image. In this 
work, we have used the Inception V3 model. After the successful 
testing of the CNN model, we have deployed the model on an Android 
Application.
